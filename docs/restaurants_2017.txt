Almond Haus
Date: 9/9/2017
Location: 10100 Westminster Ave Garden Grove, CA 92843
Food: Coconut Thai Tea with boba
Overall: 3.7 / 5.0 (The drinks here are less expensive than the standard price. While most boba places have solid, cube-like ice to maintain the coldness of a drink, this place has crushed ice, which helps to maintain the coldness of a drink without taking too much volume. Generous amounts of boba were given, so I did not have to worry about finishing the drink way after all the boba runs out. The coconut Thai tea is soothing, and it has just the right amount of sweetness despite the fact that I did not specifically request the drink to be made with less sweetness. Overall, I really loved the drink as it is not watered down and there is nothing that would raise eyebrows that the person making it is cutting corners.)

Ana Maria
Date: 8/17/2017
Food: Carnitas Gorditas
Location: Grand Central Market
Overall: 3.5 / 5.0 (The gorditas are downright amazing. The warm, lightly toasted pastry is combined with generous amounts of delicious carnitas and crema sauce. It looks good, but there can still be some improvement with how they put the ingredients in the gorditas. I enjoy the fact they give so much that it's overflowing and it gets messy eating, but how they cut the gorditas was the biggest flaw. It might have been a mistake, and I am pretty sure they typically prepare gorditas properly. Regardless, I greatly enjoyed this meal and I think this is one of the best gorditas I have tried.)

Artisan Cheese and Wine
Date: 8/4/2017
Food: Chopped salad with ranch dressing and various Italian sandwiches (salami, turkey, bacon, garlic aioli spreading, garlic bread)
Overall: 3.4 / 5.0 (The salad was a good side. Sandwiches were interesting and tasty, involving quite some garlic. The bread itself doesn't feel fresh, but the contents of the sandwiches were fresh and healthy. Some of the sandwiches’ contents fall off way too easily based on how they distributed the ingredients, so it got quite messy and thus I needed a fork to put back the ingredients into the bread. The combination of the contents provides a good balance of flavor, which worked in favor of the quality rating.)

Asiago Grilled Cheese
Date: 7/27/2017
Location: 350 S Grand Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90071
Food: Santa Fe BBQ Chicken Signature Grilled Cheese Sandwich
Overall: 3.2 / 5.0 (The sandwich is toasted properly, and the BBQ sauce does not overwhelm the flavor of the jack pepper cheese. The purpose of this sandwich is primarily the grilled cheese, and so the preparation is done well. However, the ingredients were not given generously, and for the cost of the sandwich, there should be more chicken, corn, and beans. Nonetheless, this sandwich makes a great, satisfying meal.)

Barista Society

Location: 300 S Grand Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90071
Food: Amazonia Breeze, small cold brew
Overall: 3.4 (was 3.3) / 5.0 
(8/15/17 - The drink was delicious and has colorful layers: the bottom of the drink is sugar cane juice while the top is a frothy combination of pineapple, ginger, etc. The combination of ingredients makes the drink soothing and enjoyable. 
8/31/17 - I redeemed a free small cold brew coffee to recover from sleep deprivation from last night, to produce a more fair rating of this place. After all, this place specializes in their coffee. The coffee was prepared very well and definitely stands out from the cheap coffee. I suppose the beans are very high quality, as the coffee is not overly bitter. I opted to not add anything to taste the natural flavor of the coffee, and I greatly enjoyed it. Personally, I will not really go out of my way to go to this place because it is very pricey.)

Overall: 3.5 / 5.0 (Take this review with a grain of salt since these foods are catered from the Jamaica Bay Inn, so the actual restaurant quality may differ. Food is nicely presented and is on the higher end, which makes the quality of the food better. Taking into account the similar grouping of high quality food, the food itself is comparatively delicious but not the best I have tried. It is worth it for the view and the party.)

Belcampo Meat Co.
Date: 8/21/2017
Location: Grand Central Market
Food: Fast Burger with Caramelized Onion
Overall: 3.1 / 5.0 (This restaurant boasts about their beef as grass-fed, and indeed there is quite some difference from most burgers I have tried, for the better. With that, I know I will pay a bit of a premium, but the burger is still overpriced, especially being charged for substituting raw onions with caramelized onions. I was slightly disappointed the burger was prepared quite sloppily, but a bite into the burger kind of resolved this disappointment. The beef patty is cooked to medium, and crispy lettuce, onions, and the house sauce balance the burger’s flavor quite well without anything overpowering the other ingredients. This burger does stand out in its quality, and I can taste the premium ingredients.)

Date: 8/30/2017
Location: Not sure where it is catered, as there are multiple LA locations
Food: Carne asada tacos, chicken tacos, lettuce, lime wedges, salsa, rice, pinto beans, chips, guacamole, and churros
Overall: 3.0 / 5.0 (Tacos were generally poorly assembled, but everything else was presented decently well. Tacos were not as delicious as several other Mexican places I have tried already, and the tortillas were a bit mushy in some areas. The carne asada tacos were delicious, but the chicken tacos were an absolute disaster. The rice and beans were decent. I also greatly enjoyed the chips and guacamole, but the guacamole is also not the best I have tried. Nonetheless, the churros are possibly the redeeming factor as it was one of the best churros I have ever tried. It has a creamy filling inside, and the preparation for this was done very well.

Berlin Currywurst
Date: 8/31/2017
Location: Grand Central Market
Food: Bauernpfanne - Sausage Hash (original currywurst sauce, Nuernberger (veal, pork sausage))
Overall: 2.2 / 5.0 (Even factoring in the fact that some places in Grand Central Market are more expensive than average, this place is quite overpriced. One sausage with one egg and potatoes for $9? Well, it’s worth it if the food is actually good. First disappointment was that they served the order in a bowl, which did not have a compatible lid for to-go. Then, they put the order into a to-go box and the presentation aspect significantly plummeted. Second disappointment was the sauce. I really enjoyed the sauce, but it was overly salty. The sausage was delicious, but in no way does the quality match the price they charge. The eggs and potatoes were pretty standard, but they were average at best. No wonder why there is no line to this place.)

Location: 413 S Main St, Los Angeles, CA 90013
Food: Mini cupcakes (red velvet, carrot, chocolate, black & white, lemon)
Overall: 3.3 / 5.0 (The cupcakes are pretty small, and you can basically eat one in just one bite. $1 bites anyone? Visually, the cupcakes are designed quite well, as the frosting is placed properly without falling apart. I especially liked the decoration of the carrot cake one, as there is a cute little carrot decor on top of the frosting. Unlike some cupcakes that crumble apart as you eat, this did not, perhaps due to the size. However, I think the cupcakes are cooked very well as each bite adds on to the previous one. They are very sweet as expected. Nonetheless, they are a great option if you want a quick snack to satisfy your sweet tooth.)

Overall: 3.3 / 5.0 (Even with the happy hour prices, the dishes were still very expensive. However, the food looks extremely appetizing and tastes very good. The preparation and ingredients are possible factors that make this American food stand out from the rest. Service was very good but not impeccable, as the waiters made several mistakes in which dishes go where in the table. A nice “milk bottle” container of water were given for us to freely refill, which is a plus.)

Overall: 4.0 / 5.0 (This place is so small: only 30 seats, and it is truly a hole in the wall place. This place is decently priced, but not really a bargain. The dishes are crafted well and look mouth watering. The Laksa is amazing! The coconut milk/curry soup is so filling and satisfying, and the noodles have perfect consistency. As bonus points, even my Indonesian and Singaporean friends say this is authentic! The gado gado is a great appetizer and apparently a street eat in Jakarta. The crunchy, fresh cucumbers complement the toppings very well. Service is good, but not impeccable, with respect to Asian restaurants. Flagging down a server to fulfill requests is easy and the request is satisfied rather quickly. I would definitely return to this place in the future, and I highly recommend you give it a try.)

Bottega Louie
Date: 9/1/2017
Location: 700 S Grand Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90017
Food: Napoleon (pastry), pillow cake, earl grey and tiramisu (September macaron of the month) macarons
Overall: 4.2 / 5.0 (One of my friends showed me this place one time and I was thinking “Wow, I really want to try the desserts here.” Now my wish came true. First of all, the desserts are extremely expensive, but the quality of the dessert is well justified, so this factor is normalized. 
For the Napoleon, vanilla bean diplomat cream & caramelized puff pastry, there is a neat purple box that goes with it. The purple box has a gold engraved “Bottega Louie” with gold decorations such as a palm tree, fish, horseshoe, cherry, panda, and various stars. That itself wows me in terms of presentation. For the Napoleon itself, the pastry is carefully layered and expertly prepared, as there are no burnt sections from the caramelizing. However, it was not completely perfect, as some powdered sugar was missing on the top of the pastry. I greatly enjoyed the Napoleon. The crispy thin wafers are very buttery and complement very well with the cream. The cream is neither too bland nor too sweet - it was just the perfect amount. However, that may be because I only cut off a small section to savor the flavor, as it will be a waste to only eat this in one sitting without sharing; regardless, the balance of the ingredients is there. 
I also got the chance to try the pillow cake, which I got a small piece of in exchange for some of the Napoleon. The pillow cake consists of white chocolate mousse, lychee & rose gelée, raspberry crème & speculoos crust. The pillow cake was also very good - I expected the cream to just be regular cream, but it is not! As I took my first bite, the cream was very puffy indeed; it definitely resembles a pillow. 
The macarons are very tiny but they each have distinct presentation. The filling, which I believe is the ganache, is a bit sweet but the cookie surrounding it balances out the sweetness. The cookie is also slightly chewy. The ingredients inside provide an excellent balance of flavor too. The desserts here just wow me, and I am already a harsh critic.)

Brodard Restaurant

Food: Nem Nöôùng Cuoán (pork spring roll), Chaïo Toâm Cuoán (shrimp spring roll), Chaû Gio (eggroll), Toâm Hoûa Tieãn (rocket shrimp roll), Baùnh Khoït (Luna rice cake), Baùnh Xeøo (pan-fried flour crepe), Baùnh Canh Gioø Heo (pork hocks udon), 
Note that the above, I copied and pasted the Vietnamese from the menu on their website, and some of the letters were not able to be interpreted by ASCII, so please note that, if you’re able to read Vietnamese, most of the words above may be incorrect.
Overall: 3.7 / 5.0 (Located approximately around Little Saigon is this restaurant, which is relatively popular. Wait time for a large party was surprisingly short, at 30 minutes, although there were about 15 parties ahead of us. It was pretty difficult to decide what food to order, so we just ordered a ton of dishes and share everything. It was a great experience (except the service), as I got to try a ton of dishes. 
Although we ordered a lot of dishes and the cost accumulates quickly, I think that overall, the cost is very fair. All the dishes are aesthetically pleasing, especially the spring rolls. Most of the dishes have large amounts of lettuce and greens to enhance the color of the dishes, even though the dishes themselves look appetizing enough without all the embellishments. 
	The spring rolls are a must-try if you are trying out this restaurant. The pork spring roll has a nice texture on the outside and is crunchy inside. Dipping it with their special sauce which contains peanuts, it was truly amazing. The pork itself is seasoned well, which is on par with the pork present in Bún (rice vermicelli) that is found in many Vietnamese restaurants. The shrimp spring roll was a bit unexpected, as I expected whole shrimp in the spring roll. It was shrimp paste, which was better than I initially thought. I think that the shrimp paste complements the overall flavor of the spring roll better than had it been whole shrimp.
	Eggroll was pretty standard, and I think that its quality pales in comparison to the delicious spring rolls. I think I have tried better eggrolls in other restaurants.
	Rocket shrimp roll was a bit dry, but the preparation for it was a bit interesting. The top is filled with crab meat, while the bottom is the shrimp. Regardless, it was pretty good but not really worth the price tag.
	Luna rice cake is also a must-try, as the crispy rice cake layer is quite buttery. The shrimp was mediocre because it is just the standard, lower-end shrimp. However, what is important was the rice cake, and they did an excellent job making these.
	The crepe is not the sweet ones you would expect in dessert places. It was cooked just like any other dish, with similar flavor as the Luna rice cake. The only difference is just what is contained inside, which include shrimp, sliced pork, onion, mung beans and bean sprouts. 
	The pork hocks udon was pretty good, but unfortunately does not compete with the higher quality udon places such as Marugame Monzo in terms of the udon texture. The udon was a bit overcooked as it was somewhat mushy, but the broth is mouth-watering. Its taste can be attributed to the roasted shallots and fried onions. The dish overall was delicious since they had a proper selection of ingredients that would maximize the flavor.
	Service was very poor, as it took very long to get the iced water. It is quite a challenge to get the attention of a waiter or waitress to fulfill simple requests such as refilling iced water, and most of the time, they just look the other direction and pretend to not hear you. I get it that this restaurant is very popular and is busy on a Saturday night, but honestly service would have been significantly better had they had a better response to requests.

Carl’s Jr.

Food: Western Bacon Cheeseburger
Overall: 1.5 / 5.0 (I don’t think it was worth the price in the fast food restaurants tier. I can get tacos easily for way cheaper and I would be greatly satisfied. For this burger, I think it was very sloppily prepared. The cheese is concentrated in one half of the burger. The patty is dry, but what more do you expect from some fast food restaurant that is NOT McDonald’s? What kind of sauce did they put in to make this messy, disgusting creation? It smells like BBQ sauce but I feel like it’s something questionable. Why did I go here? Because I was in a hurry to a concert and needed to grab something fast. I mean, it was fast; it took 2 minutes and had it been a bit longer, I would have missed the shuttle. Also, I needed some more restaurants that can represent the lower end of the spectrum of my restaurant ratings.)

The raisin bagel did not really have too much flavor to it, while the everything bagel is very delicious. I still prefer UCLA Study at Hedrick’s everything bagel because they did it better than Corner Bakery. Muffins are a bit too sweet and mediocre, as expected from a chain restaurant. This is a great place to just fill you up for a meal, but it is not necessarily delicious nor is there anything that really stands out.)

Food: Avocado Toast (with herbed ricotta cheese)

There were no oxidization in the avocado at all, especially because it was freshly cut. The sandwich is similar to garlic bread in taste, but better. The avocados complement the ricotta cheese and the cherry tomatoes provide a bit of sweetness to balance the saltier cheese. The avocados and cheese are piled high in the toast, so there are opportunities to solely taste these ingredients separate from the bread. The black pepper and small chopped green onions provide a cherry on top in terms of presentation and taste.)

It was healthy and enjoyable, which is obvious because this is their specialty, but while I do taste the almond milk and fruit, it is somewhat watered down. It is somewhat watered down and not “lacking sugar due to only using natural sugar.” Nonetheless, I think this smoothie holds a higher quality than other places like Jamba Juice, for instance.)

Waiting in line and getting food takes less than 10 minutes if you arrive right at opening time - 8 AM. Although pricey, the coddled eggs are cooked almost perfectly. The bread is a bit hard but soft on the inside, which is a nice complement to the coddled egg/potato purée combination. The order is nicely presented, like some home decor. You get a jar at the end, if you're willing to wash it, which is a plus.)

Without the special, the pizza is more affordable than many other build your own pizza places. The pizza is cooked well but some random ingredients ended up in the pizza, and the pizza is not cut properly. However, the pizza is amazing and is comparable to the quality of higher end places such as 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizza. The pizza is chewy and delicious, and the pesto sauce provides a great complement to the toppings. Chicken is a bit dry, but the chipotle sausage is delicious.)

Food: Roast beef sandwich, Goddess chicken sandwich
Overall: 3.4 / 5.0 (Sandwiches were very good, but the bread is somewhat soggy from the distribution of the sauce. Ingredients-wise, the food is on the high end, with the Goddess chicken sandwich having a good balance of flavor)

Food: Strawberry sorbet, amaretto cherry and cream gelato
Overall: 3.1 / 5.0 (The gelato was pretty creamy and delicious, but there was really nothing that makes this place stand out. Price is decent, although for this price, I would greatly prefer McConnell’s, despite the fact that ice cream is slightly different from gelato. I like the fact that the gelato is not too sugary, which makes a great treat for a midday snack or a dessert after a meal.)

Food: Falafel Burger
Overall: 2.7 / 5.0 (The falafel burger is pretty good and crispy, but it was sloppily prepared and not worth the price, looking at the presentation and overall quality of the food itself. What was good was the falafel; in terms of tastiness, it is up there with the other falafel places I have tried. However, the burger bun is a bit soggy and the lettuce is not crispy enough, making it feel like it is partially cooked. The sauce somewhat goes well with the falafel, which is a plus. Although the quality is just average, I nonetheless finished the meal slightly satisfied.)

Guisados
Date: 9/14/2017
Location: 2100 East Cesar E Chavez Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90033
Food: Sampler (6 mini tacos): Steak picado, bistek en salsa roja, mole poblano, chicharron, chuleta, and chorizo
Overall: 3.8 / 5.0 (Although there is a Guisados at Downtown LA, I opted to try the original Guisados which is located in Boyle Heights just for a different experience. Also, this was a perfect spot to have dinner during my adventurous 7 mile walk from the office to my house.
Price is pretty fair and you get a decent amount for the value. The mini tacos are pretty tiny but the meat and other ingredients above the tortilla are given pretty generously. Also, the tortilla is pretty thick which allows you to at least taste a bit of the tortilla flavor while eating the taco. Each of the individual tacos are prepared well, and although it is kind of a take-out restaurant with seating, the dine-in tray of tacos are nonetheless prepared very neatly. All the ingredients are properly placed in the respective tacos, and all the ingredients can be easily seen at first glance. 
	The steak picado contains flank steak simmered with green bell peppers and bacon. It also contains green serrano chile and black beans. I think that this is pretty decent, and the steak tastes like soy sauce which is a bit interesting. The steak is very tender as well. However, there was a bit too much sauce in this taco.
	The bistek en salsa roja contains flank steak simmered with red bell peppers and tomatoes. It is served with chile de arbol and avocado, as well as black beans. For this one, I greatly enjoyed the avocado which provides a great balance of flavor with the marinated bistek. 
	The mole poblano contains shredded chicken breast in a nutty Poblano style Mole. It is served with sour cream, queso fresco, red onion, and diced chile. I really loved the flavor of the mole, which is just what I expected. The sour cream isn’t really sour cream, and it feels more like the Mexican crema found in gorditas. The queso fresco did not have too strong of a flavor, which, in my opinion, is a plus. The red onion did not really go well with the overall flavor, however.
	The chicharron contains pork rinds simmered in chile verde. It is served with green serrano chile and black beans. This taco is a bit interesting because it is the soft version of the crunchy Mexican snack. I really loved the flavor for this despite the fact that I am not really accustomed to the soft texture of the chicarrones. This more closely resembles the general roasted meats found in most Mexican taco stands, which is great, despite the fact it is simmered with other ingredients. 
	The chuleta contains diced pork chop in a chile verde. It is served with black beans with chile arbol, green serrano chile, and sour cream. Again, the sour cream feels more like Mexican crema in texture. The meat here is also very good since it is tender and flavorful. The mixture of different sauces makes this taco a bit complex to distinguish a specific flavor, but it was still a pretty delicious taco. 
	The chorizo contains Mexican sausage en su jugo served with red onion, green serrano chile, chile arbol, and black beans. I didn’t really like this taco because the combination of ingredients was a bit weird, especially because it contains red onion. Don’t get me wrong; I love onions, but it just does not really go well with the meat. Nevertheless, I like the chorizo meat.)

Meat is just meat, so the presentation factor is mostly from the setup, which is quite aesthetically pleasing. Service is decent, with someone helping out with cooking. However, the waitress is slow on refilling some food (called banchan) and water: hence the score deduction)

Broth was flavorful and soothing, which complements well with the well-cooked ramen noodles. You get to even choose the firmness of the noodles, which I chose medium. Service was very good, but the waiter failed to initially give me an iced water during his distribution of iced water to the party.)

Overall: 3.1 / 5.0 (The food was pretty delicious and smokey, with some dry bits in the pulled pork that really brings that BBQ flavor out. However, the meats are too watery and I end up with mushy rolls while eating the meats, which wasn't too appetizing. The watery nature also mixes with the slaws, making once a delicious dish have weird combination of flavors.)

Howlin’ Rays
Date: 9/14/2017
Location: 727 N Broadway, Ste 128, Los Angeles, CA 90012
Food: Hot chicken sando (mild) (boneless breast, slaw, comeback sauce, pickles, butter bun), whole wings (mild), solo wing (Howlin!), peach tea (unsweetened)
Overall: 4.3 / 5.0 (The line to Howlin’ Rays was so long. We came at 11:33AM and finally got to order at 1:28 PM, making it almost a 2 hour wait. It was definitely bearable because my friends and coworkers also went and we just talked throughout the line. The food didn’t really take long, considering how much we ordered. I would say that this place lives up to the hype, but just not as much as I would want. If it had been an hour wait or less, this place will be almost a perfect go-to place for chicken.
At first glance, I thought I was going to spend a fortune on a meal here based on the menu pricings. This especially applies to the wings, as most wings are about $1 each; however, these wings here are a lot larger than expected, making it enough for a hearty light snack. However, the price is very justified. We each ordered a chicken sando and split 3 wings per person, but we ended up having so much leftovers for under $20 a person (perhaps enough for another meal). I think I was 90% full by the time I finished the chicken sando, if I were to not overeat like I do in UCLA Dining Halls. 
The wings look extremely appetizing; however, I took some points off for presentation of the sando. The ingredients were not distributed well in the chicken sando, as most of the slaw was outside the sando. It didn’t really affect my experience too much (although ideally I would like to only use my hands to eat the sandwich), as I felt like not getting my hands dirty for this meal.
Regardless, I think that the chicken sando was one of the best, if not the best, chicken sandwich I ever had! I think it has to do with the comeback sauce and the proper combination of flavors that the other ingredients contribute. The chicken in the sandwich was so large and tender, that I ended up having about half a chicken breast left by the time I finish the sandwich. 
The wings are very flavorful; I think that they did a very good job with the seasoning. Comparatively, the wings are even better than the chicken sandwich. The wings, too, are very tender. The only issue overall is that the chicken has a hint of pickle flavor, which makes it just a little less ideal for me. However, that is just my preference.
The unsweetened peach tea is definitely very cold and refreshing, which helps a lot when eating spicy food. There is nothing that really stands out for this drink, other than provide a great refreshment. 
I tried a bite of the Howlin’ (the spiciest wings at Howlin’ Rays), which consisted of Carolina reaper peppers, at a Scoville scale of 1,569,300 SHU on average. I think that is the hottest pepper in the world. It also contains scorpion peppers, which I think is the second hottest pepper in the world. Just for comparison, jalapeños are approximately 2500-8000. They even gave you thick rubber gloves for you, should you eat with your hands. This is because with this amount of spiciness, you would definitely burn your eyes and other sensitive regions when you make contact with the pepper. I, along with some people in the office, tried a bite of this Howlin’ wing. After about 30 seconds in, I was dying. Holy %^&* what in the world did I just eat? My tongue was burning, but it subsided within 15 minutes, which almost felt like an eternity. During those 15 minutes, I drank some milk and pineapple flavored Hint water to make myself feel better, but to no avail. It was just a matter of time before the burn subsided. Longer term effects include: my throat burns when I burp, and taking a dump was a bit painful. Some of us in the office each tried it, and some handled the spiciness quite well, but regardless, it was extremely spicy. I won’t do it again honestly, just for the sake of my gastrointestinal tract.)

India Jones Chow Truck

Food: Chicken Frankie and butter chicken curry
Overall: 2.7 / 5.0 (The name of the food truck is pretty interesting; it is kind of a pun for Indiana Jones. Food is quite pricey; some parts of the frankie are mushy with chicken pieces outside the wrap, which means that it was sloppily prepared. Nonetheless, the frankie was very very delicious (2.2/2.5), but the butter chicken curry was just ok, especially with the tasteless, watery chunks of rice (1.2/2.5).)

Overall: 3.3 / 5.0 (The burrito looks small, as it can easily fit inside a small to-go box. However, it was easily very filling, and a burrito can be eaten over 2 meals (at the very least, 2 breakfasts). The burrito was rolled pretty well, as it was not messy eating the food despite the fact that the burrito is overflowing with eggs, hash brown, cheese, and sausage. The sausage in the burrito is not what you may expect in fast food places, as they actually cut the sausage into relatively large pieces. I find that a bit different from the norm. The hash brown kind of dominated the burrito, but it didn’t really bother me because every other ingredient is given quite generously. I think the hash brown is kind of mushy, but it seems like that is how their breakfast burrito is made, which I am totally fine with. Overall, it was a very filling and delicious breakfast, and I would say that it is an excellent alternative to Eggslut if you find yourself traversing through long lines in Eggslut.)

Location: 3465 W 6th St, Los Angeles, CA 90020
Food: Beef Combo (thinly sliced brisket, seasoned prime boneless short rib, prime boneless short rib, kimchi stew) and Pork Combo (premium seared pork belly, premium pork jowl, thinly sliced spicy pork belly)
Overall: 4.1 / 5.0 (Hae Jang Chon was so good that I thought there would not be a better Korean BBQ restaurant, but this restaurant blew this notion to pieces. Although it is not all you can eat, and the price per person is higher than the all you can eat price, the meats here are so fresh, tender, and flavorful even on its own. Wait time was surprisingly a measly 20 minutes for a large group, on a weekend near prime dinner time, unlike what most reviews said. 
	Banchan here is a bit different, as there were kimchi pancakes, steamed egg, corn cheese, onion, kimchi, kimchi stew (which came with the combos), and seaweed, along with the lettuce salad and veggie salad. There were not any fish cakes, bean sprouts, etc. Everything here is placed very nicely, even the raw meats. I greatly enjoyed the steamed egg, which was not overcooked and rough. It was pretty smooth and creamy. The corn cheese was also creamy, but the quality of other side dishes pales in comparison to the meats, which will be described below. Also, the kimchi stew was too salty and spicy for my tastes, which was slightly disappointing. The salads, however, were better than I expected. The lettuce was very fresh and there were no wilted lettuce anywhere in the bowl. The salad itself was not too sour, which makes a great side dish to eat while eating the meats.
	It was nice to have a piece of paper that tells you the best way to eat the meats in a KBBQ place, which allows newbies to make the most out of the KBBQ experience. After many mediocre KBBQ experiences from lower quality places, I did not really like the salad and the dipping sauce. However, I decided that, because I am seeking the full KBBQ experience, why not try everything, even things I don’t generally like?
	We first ordered the beef combo. The thinly sliced brisket was not too thin that would make the meat overly crispy and dry. It was just the right juiciness that it was so tasty without the dipping sauce. I also dipped the meat into the dipping sauce and had a completely different reaction to what I expected. Their dipping sauce is actually very good and mixes well with the meat flavors. The prime boneless short rib, unmarinated, was so tender that it felt like eating a medium or medium rare steak at a steakhouse. The meat texture is the same for the seasoned prime boneless short rib. The marinated version was not too sweet unlike the lower quality all you can eat marinated beef. It was more flavorful than sweet, and it is equally delicious with and without the dipping sauce. Personally, I did not dip the marinated meats since I like the marinated sauce flavor.
	Then, we ordered the pork combo. I did not even know I was eating pork belly until 5 minutes into eating the pork! It was not so fatty like the other KBBQ places. Although it had a sizable amount of fat, it produced a great, bacon-like flavor that I did not need to spit out the fat. The pork jowl was pretty delicious and the texture was also pretty premium. However, I did not really enjoy the spicy pork belly because it had way too much fat compared to the regular pork belly aforementioned. 
	Service here is flawless, which is probably because there were a ton of servers. One or two servers were in charge of cooking the meats to a very fine quality, which is one factor that made the meats so good (the other factor is probably the meat quality itself). I specifically only drank the barley tea, which was a great alternative to iced water. The barley tea was refilled very quickly, and once we ran out, all we need to do is subtly signal to the server and he or she will immediately refill it for you. This also applies to the side dishes.

Overall: 3.8 / 5.0 (While the cost is on the higher end, I believe the freshness of the raw fish definitely is worth the higher price. The hand rolls look appetizing and is wrapped very well, although it just looks like a plain hand roll. It's nice to see the chef carefully preparing the hand roll, as we are seated at an open bar with the chef preparing the rolls on the inside. The hand rolls are given one at a time to ensure freshness, and as I try raw fish the first time, I greatly enjoyed this first impression of raw fish, especially because I always think that raw fish is very fishy and slimy. The textures of the yellowfish and snapper are quite interesting. The blue crab hand roll gives a proper finish to the meal, as it is something that is more familiar to my palate. Service is decent, as the server checks up on us on how we are doing.)

Overall: 2.4 / 5.0 (The food looks appetizing and worth what I paid for, but the food quality itself is quite subpar. The beef BBQ had some good pieces of meat, but the meat itself is of low quality. Some pieces are too sweet and some lack flavor, making the quality of the beef inconsistent. Rice was decent, but the beef had too much water, making the rice on that side soggy. The fish cake and bean sprouts are just mediocre. Japchae is decent, however, so that's a plus. I think they added way more oil than necessary, as I felt bloated for the whole day after the meal.)

The ceviche looks very appealing as the ingredients are carefully placed around even though the dish itself contains lots of ingredients mixed together. Although the dish is a bit too sour from overusing the lemon/lime juice, the seafood is very fresh and delicious. It was a great meal to have if you want a twist of Mexican/Latin American cuisine.)

Overall: 3.9 / 5.0 (Such high quality pasta for similar prices as lower tier Italian restaurants makes this place worth every penny. The bread as appetizer is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Dipping it with olive oil or chili oil, the bread was a great start to the meal. The sauce goes very well with the pasta. In fact, the pasta itself is so much different because it's handmade pasta! The texture is amazing; I can feel the authentic Italian vibe right there. Service was average; there wasn’t anything stellar about the service, but I had a good experience with the place.)

The wraps here are a bit pricey and I think that you get more value on the dollar with the side order, despite the intuition that appetizers and side dishes are pricier than main dishes on the dollar. The falafel looks interesting, as typical ones are spherical, while this one resembles a cube. The smell is wonderful, and as I took a bite, it is full of spices. The sauces go well with the falafel, and I personally loved the spicy green sauce. Each of the sauces has their own spices, which blends in with the falafel well. Even without the sauces, it is still delicious.)

Water being provided with menus to look at gave me a good impression when I arrived, since it gives the impression that the people cared about the customers. The takoyaki is carefully prepared, with generous amounts of squid. The creamy urchin udon is irresistible; I am basically addicted to the broth. The Sansai udon is also delicious, which is a decent vegetarian option. Seafood salad is decent as well, which served as the side. Service was honestly impeccable; the Asian waitresses are attentive and refill water almost instantly when I finish the water.)

Overall: 3.5 / 5.0 (The ice cream is very high quality, and although it costs a lot more than typical ice cream places, it is decently priced for the quality. The waffle cone makes the dessert very large psychologically, even though it is the same 2 scoops size as if you put 2 scoops on a cup with spoon. However, the waffle cone has a relatively large hole at the bottom, making the ice cream drip fiercely as I trek back to the office. Regardless, the ice cream is indeed very high quality and creamy. The amount of sugar used is perfect, and the tangy Eureka lemon & marionberries fused with the saltier sea salt cream & cookies provide an excellent difference of flavors in the ice cream.)

Refried beans lack flavor, while the Mexican rice is pretty decent. The second time around, although the ingredients were not the freshest, the chicken and steak are significantly better. They are not dry, and they are flavorful. However, I have tried way better chicken and steak elsewhere, especially because these ones are quite burnt. The beans and Mexican rice are still mediocre at best, but at least the protein is good. The soyrizo is a pretty decent vegetarian option as well.)

Food: Vietnamese bun rice noodles, lemongrass chicken, pork, vegetarian tofu and mushrooms, lettuce and mint, cucumbers, bean sprouts, julienned carrots, green onions, peanuts, fish sauce, peanut sauce -- for build your own bun noodle bowl
Overall: 3.4 / 5.0 (The food in general is prepared well, and the flavor of the meats stand out. All the ingredients are fresh, and the noodles are not overly mushy. Fish sauce needs a bit more flavor, but I think the food is good enough with just the well seasoned meat and other ingredients alone. I greatly enjoyed the meal.)

Nushii
Date: 8/16/2017
Location: 1055 Broxton Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90024
Food: Build your own sushi bowl: brown rice, white rice, organic free range chicken, spicy tuna, chopped kale blend, shredded romaine mix, cucumber carrot pickles, crispy potato strings, onion jalapeño mix, chopped cilantro, shredded carrots, diced green onions, Teri-racha sauce, ponzu sauce
Overall: 3.1 / 5.0 (The spicy tuna is quite mediocre, but combining it with all the other ingredients, the bowl overall is just decent. It is not because it is catered and the food temperature is made a bit closer to equilibrium; it just isn't very delicious. I greatly enjoyed the chicken and its spices, however.)

Ocean Seafood Restaurant
Date: 8/22/2017
Location: 750 N Hill St Los Angeles, CA 90012
Food: Dim Sum
Overall: 2.8 / 5.0 (Dim sum is like twice the price as those in Monterey Park/San Gabriel Valley area, and the quality is somewhat similar (though MP/SGV dim sums are better). The place features lots of decorations and the food is presented quite well. Service is decent for a Chinese restaurant, as you don’t expect the waiters/waitresses automatically do stuff for you unless you ask. Flagging down a person for requests is moderately easy. The dim sum isn’t really the best I have tried, but it is decent. There is some MSG put in, which is somewhat unusual nowadays when most dim sum places are MSG-free. Regardless, the dim sum is authentic and overall good enough for the meal to be satisfying.)

Olio GCM Wood Fired Pizzeria
Date: 9/5/2017
Location: Grand Central Market
Food: Margherita Plus with dry cured pepperoni
Overall: 3.4 / 5.0 (The price is fair but on the higher end, but at least there was an offer that gave 10% discount. Pizza looks very good, with the only thing not good is that there are some bubbles and burned areas, but they are infrequent. It was also very delicious. The way they cooked it is better than almost all the other pizza places I have tried. The pepperoni, margherita sauce, and basil provide great flavor to the soft texture of the pizza. The burrata cheese on top was a bit interesting as it is different from the fast food pizza places where the cheese stretches the whole pizza minus the crust. They applied 4 dollops of cheese, one for each slice. The cheese was quite creamy but the flavor was not too strong that could overpower the other ingredients. I think the general quality of the pizza is superior to almost all the wood fired pizza places I have tried, and I had a different experience with eating this pizza than the typical pizzas.)

Panda Express
Date: 7/11/2017
Location: 350 S Grand Ave, Ste R1, Los Angeles, CA 90071
Food: Orange chicken + teriyaki chicken with chow mein and brown rice
Overall: 1.8 / 5.0 (Fortunately (or to them, unfortunately), this particular meal was overly salty and tasted worse than other occasions when I tried Panda Express, so I get to give a savage review here! The meal looks sloppy like downgraded cafeteria food. Food is mediocre as expected, but at least this server was generous in giving out food. However, quantity != quality in this case. The food is a bit too salty due to the amount of sauces put in, even the orange chicken; perhaps they're a bit too salty that downtown LA has much better food places around?)

PBJ.LA
Date: 8/21/2017
Location: Grand Central Market
Food: Red Eye, toasted (Espresso peanut butter made with bulletproof coffee, dark chocolate raspberry jam)
Overall: 3.2 / 5.0 (The packaging and the sleeve is branded and looks modern, abstract, and a bit hippy, which brings up the presentation factor. The sandwich had some flaws aesthetically, which made the sandwich itself look somewhat ugly, but it did not hinder the quality and experience. Sandwich was lightly toasted, so there were no crumbs flying everywhere whenever I take a bite. The sandwich was very good, and it left me satisfying in the end. There is indeed some distinction compared with typical PB&J sandwiches, as apparently they used more premium ingredients, which made this generally delicious.)

Pho Filet 2
Date: 9/9/2017
Location: 2643 San Gabriel Blvd Rosemead, CA 91770
Food: #15 (Pho with filet rare steak, well-done flank, brisket, tendon, tripe, and meatball)
Overall: 3.1 / 5.0 (The pho here is quite a bargain if you are looking for a slightly less expensive meal. Served in a large bowl, the pho and its accompanying meat are carefully presented, and the food was ready rather quickly. The broth is spiced well and is a bit stronger than other broths in other Vietnamese places. The pho is cooked to an almost perfect consistency, as most of the pho noodle is neither too firm nor too soft, although some parts of it are a bit too firm. Meats are fresh and the soup is hot enough, as expected, to properly cook the rare meat. Service was below average, as it was somewhat challenging to flag down a server to refill iced waters, and it took quite a while for the drinks to arrive. In fact, the drinks arrived about 10 minutes after all the food was served.)

Pie Dog
Date: 9/2/2017
Location: 229 E Commonwealth Ave Fullerton, CA 92832
Food: Hot Box burger and buffalo wings
Overall: 2.3 / 5.0 (I think the hype is the reason everything here is relatively overpriced. The hot box burger is a foodie adventure, a burger filled with mac and cheese, hot cheetos, and red mayo spread. In general, the burger was sloppily prepared. Mac and cheese and hot cheetos were flying around and not placed properly on the burger. However, the food in general was pretty delicious but does not live up to the hype. Service was quite below average. Water refills were infrequent and the waiter attempts to belittle our friends by asking if they are just chillin’ in the restaurant and not ordering anything - well that is because the food took way too long.)

PokeBar
Date: 8/1/2017
Location: 350 S Grand Ave, Ste D2, Los Angeles, CA 90071
Food: Medium Poke bowl with half and half brown and white rice, spicy tuna, scallop, octopus; seaweed salad and imitation crab meat; combination of house sauce and ponzu sauce; sesame oil; peanuts, furikake, crispy garlic, fried onions; pineapple, cilantro, corn, onions, cucumbers
Overall: 3.2 / 5.0 (With the insane amount of options, I think it is decently priced despite the overall cost ending up higher than typical poke bowls, but they are very exact in giving out the toppings (no accidental extra food); however, the poke bowl is a bit of a mess because they mixed the spicy tuna with all the other toppings, so it kind of ruins the distinctive flavor between the toppings and the seafood; nonetheless, it was satisfying and delicious, and the seafood is very fresh.)

Roast to Go
Date: 9/11/2017
Location: Grand Central Market
Food: Carnitas Taco
Overall: 3.4 / 5.0 (Pricing is similar to Tacos Tumbras a Tomas, but even though this is pretty much a bargain in terms of cost per meal, there were just only two tortillas. The amount of meat is comparable to other Grand Central Market places, and the server kind of implied that extra tortillas costed extra, which makes sense. Regardless, I think that this taco is prepared slightly better than other Grand Central Market places. Unfortunately, the carnitas were just above average, but at the very least, they were delicious. It was kind of dry and less flavorful than the other carnitas I have tried at Grand Central Market.)

Food: Chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, and brown rice (and saag paneer, peeli daal, basmati rice, naan, samosas, and mint chutney sauce)
Overall: 3.0 (was 3.1) / 5.0 (The curry and masala are very well seasoned with the appropriate amount of spices. The rice is neither too hard nor too soft, which provides a good complement to the curry and masala. However, the quality is just decent and not as good as some of the other curry places I have been to. The chicken the second time around was a bit too rough, but the saag paneer is spiced very well and offers a great vegetarian option to accompany all the protein. The samosas were freshly crispy as well, but I have tried better ones.)

Food: Pork and Cheese pupusa (Chicharrón con queso) with pickled cabbage (curtido)
Overall: 3.5 / 5.0 (Contrary to what people say about long waits, my pupusa was ready in about 10 minutes. The pupusa is well worth the price, and just one pupusa is pretty filling. It is very delicious, and the pickled cabbage complements the flavor very well. Also, the pupusa is very cheesy and soft, which basically melts in your mouth.)

Food: Shrimp and charbroiled chicken with sea salt rice (rice pilaf); cajun sauce and garlic butter; California citrus salad
Overall: 2.8 (was 3.1) / 5.0 (Shrimp was delicious and fresh, while the charbroiled chicken is a bit too dry; applying the garlic butter to the chicken and some cajun sauce to the shrimp make it delicious. Food is quite mediocre if eaten in itself, especially the chicken. The second time around, the garlic butter is inconsistent in texture and the shrimp is drier than usual, but the chicken is just slightly better.)

Overall: 3.1 / 5.0 (Salmon is very good, as well as the lemon chicken; they are seasoned adequately. The brown rice is too mushy, but the curry is able to somewhat complement this. Overall, the food is delicious, but not over the top impressive.)

Overall: 3.3 / 5.0 (The wrap was very huge and I am saying this as a person who eats a lot. It was very filling, which I didn't expect since it's mostly lettuce. However, the chicken and sauce were given generously, and the wrap was very fresh, crispy, and delicious. It's quality is comparable to Au Bon Pain in the east coast.)

Food: Bulgogi + Soon Tofu (Assorted - beef, pork, shrimp, clams)
Overall: 1.3 / 5.0 (Let me cut to the chase - this place sucks! First, before reading on, look at my scores for Panda Express and McDonald’s. Although in a similar price category as other tofu places, I feel like I got ripped off based on how bad this food is. Bulgogi is decently seasoned but bland in general, and it was 80% onions and vegetables and just 20% beef. The tofu soup was so bad I grimaced every bite. Who in the world smashes the clams so that you get to chew on “sand” (clam fragments) almost every single bite? The only thing that saves this absolute wreckage was the side dishes, but even then, there wasn’t even fried fish. By the way, there was rice, but it was not served in a stone pot. The stone pot is a staple to the soon tofu, and they have to be ashamed to even be a tofu house for not even adhering to a typical soon tofu experience. Service did not exist?!? No water refill and long wait time for checks. So glad there will be very good catered food tomorrow.)

Location: 735 S Figueroa St, Los Angeles, CA 90017 (FIGat7th)
Food: Red velvet, dark chocolate, carrot regular size cupcake
Overall: 3.4 / 5.0 (The cupcakes look relatively plain but appealing as their design is quite minimalistic. I don't really see the point of the sugar circles on top besides presentation, as the sweetness is kind of undermined by the frosting. The cupcake is pretty standard in terms of quality, but it is quite delicious and very filling. Half a cupcake is sufficient for dessert, as it is somewhat too sweet. The cake underneath is not too crumbly, which is a plus.)

Overall: 3.5 / 5.0 (Presentation is decent and the sticky rice complements the flavor of the chicken. Papaya salad is decent as well, and the fact that I am not a salad person and finished it means that it is prepared well. BBQ Chicken was very delicious and the meat is not dry at all. The flavor is there without the need to dip into the sweet chili sauce. The chicken was a bit burnt, which I counted a total of 0.6 pieces of chicken, but the smoked flavor somewhat compensates this.)

The texture makes the dessert very appealing to my taste buds, especially since the marshmallow helps the warm waffle create a melt-in-your-mouth experience. However, the chocolate ice cream didn't have much flavor, lacking sufficient flavor, and the strawberries may or may not be fresh.)

Overall: 3.7 / 5.0 ($3.50 for “one” taco which I was glad I only ordered “one” because I almost could not finish it. I asked for extra tortillas, for no extra cost, so that one taco, combined with a generous amount of meat, got me 8 tacos. The stack of tortillas given were a bit hard to split, so it gets quite messy. The carnitas were flavorful just like smoked meat, with the onions and cilantro to top it off with a pleasant aroma. The carnitas were fresh and not dry at all. All the flavor is genuine, with no sauces to hide anything, and I wish more taco places are like this.)

Food: Vanilla earl grey milk tea with honey boba
Overall: 3.4 / 5.0 (The pricing and portion are pretty standardized. Besides the boba drink, there are pretty neat decors for you to take pictures of the drink. I think that this experience differs from those in many other boba places as, while it is a milk tea per se, there isn't really much milk put in. I think that this really brings out the flavor of the earl grey tea and gives a great contrast to the sweet honey boba. The drink is really refreshing, but I think the vanilla flavor is a bit too weak to make this drink even better.)

Food: Fried chicken dinner set with chicken rice, pickled ginger cabbage, soy glazed yams, curry creamed corn, Mac and cheese, and battered potato chips
Overall: 3.6 / 5.0 (The meal is relatively expensive for fried chicken, but each dish is prepared well. There are cute bear bottles holding ponzu sauce to dip the fried chicken with. The dinner set has chicken and each side placed aesthetically. The fried chicken is very delicious, with the crispy outer layer balancing well with the tender chicken meat inside. The mac and cheese is very creamy and the seaweed complements well to have a Japanese touch in the cuisine. The other sides were decent, but their quality pales in comparison to the fried chicken and mac and cheese. Service was surprisingly just mediocre, as the waitress did not perfectly refill the water and only does so not as fast as I expect, for a small restaurant. Also, it took a while for the check to be returned to me.)

Food: Two eggs, over easy, with steak (medium), with fried rice and sourdough toast
Overall: 3.1 / 5.0 (I saw the steaks from Buzzfeed, where this one is the least expensive, so I decided to give this a try. The value is amazing: $11 for steak and all the food listed above, which was very filling. Steak looks burnt on one side, but in actuality it is slightly burnt with dark seasoning. Fried rice was decent but the rice is a bit mushy. Both the eggs and steak, however, were very good and prepared quite well. Toast was decent, which is a good side to make you full for the meal. Again, you get what you paid for, so obviously, the steak was not as good as that in fancier restaurants.)

Overall: 3.6 / 5.0 (Although 48 cents, including tax, less than Tacos Tumbras a Tomas’ tacos, the portion size proportionally varies quite a bit. Nonetheless, the one taco was filling enough, but I had room for snacking afterwards. One taco == 2 tacos but no more than that. Tortillas were super oily so it was hard to eat with just my hands. The carnitas were tender and flavorful on its own, and they are arguably slightly better than those from other Mexican places at Grand Central Market.)

Wexler’s Deli
Date: 9/7/2017
Location: Grand Central Market
Food: Macarthur Park (Pastrami, coleslaw, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, rye) with potato salad side
Overall: 3.5 / 5.0 (The sandwich is pretty premium, as reflected in the price of the meal. Although the sandwich looks very small, which is comparable to the size of homemade sandwich, it was filling because the pastrami is very thick. The potato salad side was pretty small, however. The distribution of ingredients in the sandwich is done well, as I was able to savor the Russian dressing and coleslaw with every bite of sandwich. The bread crust is not something to not look forward to, as it is quite crunchy albeit a bit hard. The inner regions of the rye bread is soft, which makes every bite in the inner regions of the sandwich almost melt in your mouth. Overall, the sandwich is very good and is definitely up there in quality with Mendocino Farms, etc. I would say that this place does an excellent job preparing the sandwich, but I think the pastrami could have been slightly better. It was a bit crumbly and dry, but nonetheless the flavor is amazing. You also get to see the chef prepare the sandwich, especially the cutting of the large pastrami meat in front of you. I must say that this place has vibes different from other Grand Central Market places in terms of decor and their selection of music. It makes you feel like you are in a restaurant separated from other vendors although in reality it is just a vendor in the midst of the hustle and bustle that is Grand Central Market.)
